<p>
Hello everyone, I'm terrible at things like blogging so I'll just start off with the basics. My name is Tristan Ancelet. I'm a technologist both in hobby and in work.
</p>

<p>
I am also a Systems Engineer and I dabble in software to automate portions of my work and to make administration and backup of my companies infrastructure much easier.
</p>

<div id="Hello World-My Journey So Far"><h2 id="My Journey So Far" class="header"><a href="#Hello World-My Journey So Far">My Journey So Far</a></h2></div>
<hr />
<p>
I started working in IT when I was 24, as a Network Tech for an ISP. In the next 2 years I then expanded into System Administration and eventually System Engineering. 
</p>


<div id="Hello World-Goals"><h2 id="Goals" class="header"><a href="#Hello World-Goals">Goals</a></h2></div>
<hr />
<div id="Hello World-Goals-Long Term"><h3 id="Long Term" class="header"><a href="#Hello World-Goals-Long Term">Long Term</a></h3></div>
<hr />
<p>
As far as my goals going forward. My long term goal is to use this degree to become much more comfortable with development so that I can get into DevOps Engineering. As having experience with development and the associated technologies (Source Control/Git, GitLab, GitHub, etc) will allow me to expand my scope to encompass those topics more easily. Which will get me closer to that goal.
</p>

<div id="Hello World-Goals-Short Term"><h3 id="Short Term" class="header"><a href="#Hello World-Goals-Short Term">Short Term</a></h3></div>
<hr />
<p>
My short Term goals is to graduate with a bachelors in Computer Science. So that I will have more time to be able to focus on my career, and to give me more time to improve my health (due to a very stationary and sedentary job).
</p>


<div id="Hello World-This Blog"><h2 id="This Blog" class="header"><a href="#Hello World-This Blog">This Blog</a></h2></div>
<hr />
<p>
This blog is just something I whipped up with using VimWiki and some auto-generation bash scripts. I am focusing on reliable (and convenient) generation of the website and NOT visual appeal. I will eventually change to custom CSS so that the style is more unique and easier to look at. However, this is far from something I feel is a priority in the short term.
