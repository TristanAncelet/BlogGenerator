Picked up a new ticket. <span id="REF-209-REF-290: Update Colors on Error Cells"></span><strong id="REF-290: Update Colors on Error Cells">REF-290: Update Colors on Error Cells</strong>. 
</p>

<div id="REF-209-What am I doing on it"><h2 id="What am I doing on it" class="header"><a href="#REF-209-What am I doing on it">What am I doing on it</a></h2></div>
<p>
Looks like this is to make make sure all "error" colors displayed (as an outline or as text color) are set to be '#fd6c5a'.
</p>

<div id="REF-209-What am I doing on it-What Have I done"><h3 id="What Have I done" class="header"><a href="#REF-209-What am I doing on it-What Have I done">What Have I done</a></h3></div>
<p>
After looking through the layout xml's I see that all of the errorColor's were all set to '#fd6c5a' manually, while '@color/text_error' was defined in colors.xml
</p>

<p>
After working on it a bit I poked at my lead (Bobby) to see what the scope of the ticket would include, as I did start going through and manually started changing errorTextColor in each layout that was needing to have it changed (from manual to the global color definition).
</p>

<p>
TL;DR:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Defined errorEnabled, errorTextColor &amp; boxStrokeErrorColor in the TextInputLayoutStyle &amp; TextInputLayoutStyleTimeout styles.

<li>
Removed errorEnabled &amp; errorTextColor defined in:

<ul>
<li>
@+id/fragment_add_profile_email_layout (in fragment_add_new_profile.xml)

<li>
@+id/fragment_login_incorrect_details (in fragment_login.xml)

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
I have to test the app and try to get to each individual section to test that each change has actually changed the colors in each area.
