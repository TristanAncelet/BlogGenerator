Looks like my master DNS server was down for the last 3 days (didn't know until the teacher mentioned it). Had to end up taking a look at my provider and it looks like my master DNS server had crashed at some point. After restarting it I got everything started up and it seems to have come back up. 
</p>

<p>
I had a backup DNS server as well, but after looking into the VM (that was still running), it turns out that I never whitelisted the DNS port (53/udp) on it. So it's entire life has been failure (as it's been the backup for several months). My thought is that I <span id="Blog Issue-DNS-DID"></span><strong id="DID">DID</strong> whitelist it but not perminately. So after a reboot it cleared the config and DNS traffic wasn't whitelisted it anymore.
</p>

<p>
Here is the commands it did to whitelist DNS (running firewalld as a device side firewall)
```bash
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Adding the DNS service to the public zone and reloading firewalld to make sure the config change takes

</ol>
<p>
firewall-cmd --perm --zone=public --add-service=dns
firewall-cmd --reload
```
</p>

<p>
After checking that DNS was resolving with dig, I was able to visit my site with no more issues.
</p>

<p>
```bash
dig blog.tristanancelet.com
```
