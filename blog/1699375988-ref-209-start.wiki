Picked up a new ticket. *REF-290: Update Colors on Error Cells*. 

== What am I doing on it ==
Looks like this is to make make sure all "error" colors displayed (as an outline or as text color) are set to be '#fd6c5a'.

=== What Have I done ===
After looking through the layout xml's I see that all of the errorColor's were all set to '#fd6c5a' manually, while '@color/text_error' was defined in colors.xml

After working on it a bit I poked at my lead (Bobby) to see what the scope of the ticket would include, as I did start going through and manually started changing errorTextColor in each layout that was needing to have it changed (from manual to the global color definition).

TL;DR:
- Defined errorEnabled, errorTextColor & boxStrokeErrorColor in the TextInputLayoutStyle & TextInputLayoutStyleTimeout styles.
- Removed errorEnabled & errorTextColor defined in:
	- @+id/fragment_add_profile_email_layout (in fragment_add_new_profile.xml)
	- @+id/fragment_login_incorrect_details (in fragment_login.xml)

=== What I have left to do ===
I have to test the app and try to get to each individual section to test that each change has actually changed the colors in each area.
