== Who Am I ==
--------------
I am Tristan Ancelet, an aspiring technologist. I enjoy working with both software and operating systems. I work as a Systems Engineer in my day job for an ISP, in this job I do both Engineering work and Administration Work. In this position I also leverage ansible and create software to help automate portions of my job so that I can cut down the time I have to spend administrating our systems.
